# Test a pen.

# If the use case for the pen is signing a loan request form from a bank in 
# order to open a low-sugar bakery, then scribbling on a scrap of paper will
# suffice.

# If the use case is writing a ten-page letter to a spouse that has been living
# in a different country for the past 10 months, then opening the pen up to 
# visually inspect the amount of ink left in the cartridge is advisable.

# If the use case is ensuring that this line of pens will not leak ink into a
# customer's pocket during an accidental bike ride in the rain, then taking a
# statistically significant sample of pens and simulating the regrettable
# conditions should work.
