# Test at-the-money options trading in a distributed banking system.

# In a distributed banking system, an option is at-the-money if the strike
# price is equal to the market value of the underlying security.  Automatic
# test methods for this type of option should include several different
# scenarios including edge cases.  If the system includes he ability to 
# autonomously trade such options, then the decision making algorithm should
# be back-tested against historic data and evaluated in terms of risk in
# addition to expected fiscal gains.
